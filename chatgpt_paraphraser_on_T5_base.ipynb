As used throughout this Agreement, the term \\u201cCon\\ufb01dential Information\\u201d means information not generally known to third parties and which is proprietary to EICA including information about EICA\\u2019s proprietary test items and item bank questions used for EICA\\u2019s certification programs, test scoring criteria for written and practical exams and other business affairs of EICA relating to the management, development, and administration of certification programs and exams. All information, oral or written, of EICA that is disclosed to Signee or to which Signee obtains access, whether originated by Signee or by the discloser or others, shall be presumed to be Con\\ufb01dential Information.\\nB. As used throughout this Agreement, the acronym \\u201cEICA\\u201d means the Electrical Industry Certifications Association.\\nC. It is understood that unauthorized disclosure or use, whether intentional or unintentional, of any of the Con\\ufb01dential Information would be detrimental to EICA and could seriously affect the fairness of EICA\\u2019s certification programs and certification exams. Accordingly, Signee agrees:\\n1. Not to use any of the Con\\ufb01dential Information for any purpose other than for or in connection with the Authorized Purpose.\\n2. To maintain all of the Con\\ufb01dential Information in con\\ufb01dence and not to disclose any portion of the Con\\ufb01dential Information to any person or entity not authorized hereunder without the prior written consent of EICA.\\n3. That, upon EICA\\u2019s request, all records, any compositions, articles, documents and other items which contain, disclose and/or embody any Con\\ufb01dential Information (including, without limitation, all copies, reproductions, summaries and notes of the contents thereof), regardless of the person causing the same to be in such form, shall be returned to EICA or destroyed by Signee, and Signee will certify that the provisions of this paragraph have been complied with.\\nD. The obligations pursuant to Section C above shall not apply to information which:\\n1. Is or becomes a part of the public domain through no act or omission of Signee;\\n2. Can be shown to be already possessed by Signee as of the date of disclosure;\\n3. Shall be made available to Signee on a non---con\\ufb01dential basis by a third party having a right to do so;\\n4. Is disclosed by order of a court of competent jurisdiction; or\\n5. EICA authorizes, in writing, for release.\\nE. In the event that Signee or its representatives receives a request to disclose all or any part of the Con\\ufb01dential Information under the terms of a valid and effective subpoena or order issued by a court of competent jurisdiction or by a governmental body, the receiving party agrees to:\\n1. Immediately notify EICA of the existence, terms and circumstances surrounding such a request, so that EICA may seek an appropriate protective order and/or waive Signee\\u2019s compliance with the provisions of this Agreement; and\\n2. If disclosure of the Con\\ufb01dential Information is required in the opinion of Signee\\u2019s counsel, to the extent possible cooperate with EICA in obtaining reliable assurances that con\\ufb01dential treatment will be accorded to the disclosed Con\\ufb01dential Information.\\nF. The parties acknowledge that the Con\\ufb01dential Information is the property of EICA, and the disclosure of the Con\\ufb01dential Information to Signee does not convey any right, title or license in the Con\\ufb01dential Information to Signee. Signee shall not appropriate the Con\\ufb01dential Information to Signee\\u2019s own use or to the use of any third party and shall only use the Con\\ufb01dential Information for the exclusive bene\\ufb01t of EICA except to the extent otherwise authorized in writing by EICA.\\nG. It is further understood and agreed that no failure or delay by EICA in exercising any right, power or privilege under this Agreement shall operate as a waiver, nor shall any single or partial exercise preclude any other or further exercise or the exercise of any right, power or privilege under this Agreement.\\nH. The termination of the discussions or relationship between the parties shall not relieve Signee or its employees, agents or af\\ufb01liates of the obligations of nonuse or nondisclosure under this Agreement or the obligation to return or destroy certain materials.\\nI. The parties agree that money damages would not be suf\\ufb01cient remedy for any breach of this Agreement, and the non---breaching party shall be entitled to enforce this Agreement by injunctive and other available relief, including without limitation speci\\ufb01c performance.\\nJ. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed and interpreted in accordance with the substantive laws of the State of Utah. Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable law, but if any provision hereof shall be prohibited by or invalid under applicable law, such provision shall be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or invalidity, without invalidating the remainder of such provision or the remaining provisions of this Agreement. All obligations of the receiving party and rights of the disclosing party expressed in this Agreement shall be in addition to, and not in limitation of, those provided by applicable law. This Agreement may be modi\\ufb01ed or waived only by a separate writing by Signee and EICA expressly so modifying or waiving such. This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, but all of which together shall constitute one instrument. References to EICA and Signee shall be deemed to include each of their af\\ufb01liates, if any.

As used throughout this Agreement, the term \\u201cCon\\ufb01dential Information\\u201d means information not generally known to third parties and which is proprietary to EICA including information about EICA\\u2019s proprietary test items and item bank questions used for EICA\\u2019s certification programs, test scoring criteria for written and practical exams and other business affairs of EICA relating to the management, development, and administration of certification programs and exams. All information, oral or written, of EICA that is disclosed to Signee or to which Signee obtains access, whether originated by Signee or by the discloser or others, shall be presumed to be Con\\ufb01dential Information.\\nB. As used throughout this Agreement, the acronym \\u201cEICA\\u201d means the Electrical Industry Certifications Association.\\nC. It is understood that unauthorized disclosure or use, whether intentional or unintentional, of any of the Con\\ufb01dential Information would be detrimental to EICA and could seriously affect the fairness of EICA\\u2019s certification programs and certification exams. Accordingly, Signee agrees:\\n1. Not to use any of the Con\\ufb01dential Information for any purpose other than for or in connection with the Authorized Purpose.\\n2. To maintain all of the Con\\ufb01dential Information in con\\ufb01dence and not to disclose any portion of the Con\\ufb01dential Information to any person or entity not authorized hereunder without the prior written consent of EICA.\\n3. That, upon EICA\\u2019s request, all records, any compositions, articles, documents and other items which contain, disclose and/or embody any Con\\ufb01dential Information (including, without limitation, all copies, reproductions, summaries and notes of the contents thereof), regardless of the person causing the same to be in such form, shall be returned to EICA or destroyed by Signee, and Signee will certify that the provisions of this paragraph have been complied with.\\nD. The obligations pursuant to Section C above shall not apply to information which:\\n1. Is or becomes a part of the public domain through no act or omission of Signee;\\n2. Can be shown to be already possessed by Signee as of the date of disclosure;\\n3. Shall be made available to Signee on a non---con\\ufb01dential basis by a third party having a right to do so;\\n4. Is disclosed by order of a court of competent jurisdiction; or\\n5. EICA authorizes, in writing, for release.\\nE. In the event that Signee or its representatives receives a request to disclose all or any part of the Con\\ufb01dential Information under the terms of a valid and effective subpoena or order issued by a court of competent jurisdiction or by a governmental body, the receiving party agrees to:\\n1. Immediately notify EICA of the existence, terms and circumstances surrounding such a request, so that EICA may seek an appropriate protective order and/or waive Signee\\u2019s compliance with the provisions of this Agreement; and\\n2. If disclosure of the Con\\ufb01dential Information is required in the opinion of Signee\\u2019s counsel, to the extent possible cooperate with EICA in obtaining reliable assurances that con\\ufb01dential treatment will be accorded to the disclosed Con\\ufb01dential Information.\\nF. The parties acknowledge that the Con\\ufb01dential Information is the property of EICA, and the disclosure of the Con\\ufb01dential Information to Signee does not convey any right, title or license in the Con\\ufb01dential Information to Signee. Signee shall not appropriate the Con\\ufb01dential Information to Signee\\u2019s own use or to the use of any third party and shall only use the Con\\ufb01dential Information for the exclusive bene\\ufb01t of EICA except to the extent otherwise authorized in writing by EICA.\\nG. It is further understood and agreed that no failure or delay by EICA in exercising any right, power or privilege under this Agreement shall operate as a waiver, nor shall any single or partial exercise preclude any other or further exercise or the exercise of any right, power or privilege under this Agreement.\\nH. The termination of the discussions or relationship between the parties shall not relieve Signee or its employees, agents or af\\ufb01liates of the obligations of nonuse or nondisclosure under this Agreement or the obligation to return or destroy certain materials.\\nI. The parties agree that money damages would not be suf\\ufb01cient remedy for any breach of this Agreement, and the non---breaching party shall be entitled to enforce this Agreement by injunctive and other available relief, including without limitation speci\\ufb01c performance.\\nJ. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed and interpreted in accordance with the substantive laws of the State of Utah. Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable law, but if any provision hereof shall be prohibited by or invalid under applicable law, such provision shall be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or invalidity, without invalidating the remainder of such provision or the remaining provisions of this Agreement. All obligations of the receiving party and rights of the disclosing party expressed in this Agreement shall be in addition to, and not in limitation of, those provided by applicable law. This Agreement may be modi\\ufb01ed or waived only by a separate writing by Signee and EICA expressly so modifying or waiving such. This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, but all of which together shall constitute one instrument. References to EICA and Signee shall be deemed to include each of their af\\ufb01liates, if any. Any disputes arising out of this Agreement shall be adjudicated in federal or state district court in the State of Utah and each party hereby consents to the jurisdiction of such court.

As used throughout this Agreement, the term \\u201cCon\\ufb01dential Information\\u201d means information not generally known to third parties and which is proprietary to EICA including information about EICA\\u2019s proprietary test items and item bank questions used for EICA\\u2019s certification programs, test scoring criteria for written and practical exams and other business affairs of EICA relating to the management, development, and administration of certification programs and exams. All information, oral or written, of EICA that is disclosed to Signee or to which Signee obtains access, whether originated by Signee or by the discloser or others, shall be presumed to be Con\\ufb01dential Information.\\nB. As used throughout this Agreement, the acronym \\u201cEICA\\u201d means the Electrical Industry Certifications Association.\\nC. It is understood that unauthorized disclosure or use, whether intentional or unintentional, of any of the Con\\ufb01dential Information would be detrimental to EICA and could seriously affect the fairness of EICA\\u2019s certification programs and certification exams. Accordingly, Signee agrees:\\n1. Not to use any of the Con\\ufb01dential Information for any purpose other than for or in connection with the Authorized Purpose.\\n2. To maintain all of the Con\\ufb01dential Information in con\\ufb01dence and not to disclose any portion of the Con\\ufb01dential Information to any person or entity not authorized hereunder without the prior written consent of EICA.\\n3. That, upon EICA\\u2019s request, all records, any compositions, articles, documents and other items which contain, disclose and/or embody any Con\\ufb01dential Information (including, without limitation, all copies, reproductions, summaries and notes of the contents thereof), regardless of the person causing the same to be in such form, shall be returned to EICA or destroyed by Signee, and Signee will certify that the provisions of this paragraph have been complied with.\\nD. The obligations pursuant to Section C above shall not apply to information which:\\n1. Is or becomes a part of the public domain through no act or omission of Signee;\\n2. Can be shown to be already possessed by Signee as of the date of disclosure;\\n3. Shall be made available to Signee on a non---con\\ufb01dential basis by a third party having a right to do so;\\n4. Is disclosed by order of a court of competent jurisdiction; or\\n5. EICA authorizes, in writing, for release.\\nE. In the event that Signee or its representatives receives a request to disclose all or any part of the Con\\ufb01dential Information under the terms of a valid and effective subpoena or order issued by a court of competent jurisdiction or by a governmental body, the receiving party agrees to:\\n1. Immediately notify EICA of the existence, terms and circumstances surrounding such a request, so that EICA may seek an appropriate protective order and/or waive Signee\\u2019s compliance with the provisions of this Agreement; and\\n2. If disclosure of the Con\\ufb01dential Information is required in the opinion of Signee\\u2019s counsel, to the extent possible cooperate with EICA in obtaining reliable assurances that con\\ufb01dential treatment will be accorded to the disclosed Con\\ufb01dential Information.\\nF. The parties acknowledge that the Con\\ufb01dential Information is the property of EICA, and the disclosure of the Con\\ufb01dential Information to Signee does not convey any right, title or license in the Con\\ufb01dential Information to Signee. Signee shall not appropriate the Con\\ufb01dential Information to Signee\\u2019s own use or to the use of any third party and shall only use the Con\\ufb01dential Information for the exclusive bene\\ufb01t of EICA except to the extent otherwise authorized in writing by EICA.\\nG. It is further understood and agreed that no failure or delay by EICA in exercising any right, power or privilege under this Agreement shall operate as a waiver, nor shall any single or partial exercise preclude any other or further exercise or the exercise of any right, power or privilege under this Agreement.\\nH. The termination of the discussions or relationship between the parties shall not relieve Signee or its employees, agents or af\\ufb01liates of the obligations of nonuse or nondisclosure under this Agreement or the obligation to return or destroy certain materials.\\nI. The parties agree that money damages would not be suf\\ufb01cient remedy for any breach of this Agreement, and the non---breaching party shall be entitled to enforce this Agreement by injunctive and other available relief, including without limitation speci\\ufb01c performance.\\nJ.

Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable law, but if any provision hereof shall be prohibited by or invalid under applicable law, such provision shall be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or invalidity, without invalidating the remainder of such provision or the remaining provisions of this Agreement. All obligations of the receiving party and rights of the disclosing party expressed in this Agreement shall be in addition to, and not in limitation of, those provided by applicable law. This Agreement may be modi\\ufb01ed or waived only by a separate writing by Signee and EICA expressly so modifying or waiving such. This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, but all of which together shall constitute one instrument. References to EICA and Signee shall be deemed to include each of their af\\ufb01liates, if any. Any disputes arising out of this Agreement shall be adjudicated in federal or state district court in the State of Utah and each party hereby consents to the jurisdiction of such court.

As used throughout this Agreement, the term \\u201cCon\\ufb01dential Information\\u201d means information not generally known to third parties and which is proprietary to EICA including information about EICA\\u2019s proprietary test items and item bank questions used for EICA\\u2019s certification programs, test scoring criteria for written and practical exams and other business affairs of EICA relating to the management, development, and administration of certification programs and exams. All information, oral or written, of EICA that is disclosed to Signee or to which Signee obtains access, whether originated by Signee or by the discloser or others, shall be presumed to be Con\\ufb01dential Information.\\nB. As used throughout this Agreement, the acronym \\u201cEICA\\u201d means the Electrical Industry Certifications Association.\\nC. It is understood that unauthorized disclosure or use, whether intentional or unintentional, of any of the Con\\ufb01dential Information would be detrimental to EICA and could seriously affect the fairness of EICA\\u2019s certification programs and certification exams. Accordingly, Signee agrees:\\n1. Not to use any of the Con\\ufb01dential Information for any purpose other than for or in connection with the Authorized Purpose.\\n2. To maintain all of the Con\\ufb01dential Information in con\\ufb01dence and not to disclose any portion of the Con\\ufb01dential Information to any person or entity not authorized hereunder without the prior written consent of EICA.\\n3. That, upon EICA\\u2019s request, all records, any compositions, articles, documents and other items which contain, disclose and/or embody any Con\\ufb01dential Information (including, without limitation, all copies, reproductions, summaries and notes of the contents thereof), regardless of the person causing the same to be in such form, shall be returned to EICA or destroyed by Signee, and Signee will certify that the provisions of this paragraph have been complied with.\\nD. The obligations pursuant to Section C above shall not apply to information which:\\n1. Is or becomes a part of the public domain through no act or omission of Signee;\\n2. Can be shown to be already possessed by Signee as of the date of disclosure;\\n3. Shall be made available to Signee on a non---con\\ufb01dential basis by a third party having a right to do so;\\n4. Is disclosed by order of a court of competent jurisdiction; or\\n5. EICA authorizes, in writing, for release.\\nE. In the event that Signee or its representatives receives a request to disclose all or any part of the Con\\ufb01dential Information under the terms of a valid and effective subpoena or order issued by a court of competent jurisdiction or by a governmental body, the receiving party agrees to:\\n1. Immediately notify EICA of the existence, terms and circumstances surrounding such a request, so that EICA may seek an appropriate protective order and/or waive Signee\\u2019s compliance with the provisions of this Agreement; and\\n2. If disclosure of the Con\\ufb01dential Information is required in the opinion of Signee\\u2019s counsel, to the extent possible cooperate with EICA in obtaining reliable assurances that con\\ufb01dential treatment will be accorded to the disclosed Con\\ufb01dential Information.\\nF. The parties acknowledge that the Con\\ufb01dential Information is the property of EICA, and the disclosure of the Con\\ufb01dential Information to Signee does not convey any right, title or license in the Con\\ufb01dential Information to Signee. Signee shall not appropriate the Con\\ufb01dential Information to Signee\\u2019s own use or to the use of any third party and shall only use the Con\\ufb01dential Information for the exclusive bene\\ufb01t of EICA except to the extent otherwise authorized in writing by EICA.\\nG. It is further understood and agreed that no failure or delay by EICA in exercising any right, power or privilege under this Agreement shall operate as a waiver, nor shall any single or partial exercise preclude any other or further exercise or the exercise of any right, power or privilege under this Agreement.\\nH. The termination of the discussions or relationship between the parties shall not relieve Signee or its employees, agents or af\\ufb01liates of the obligations of nonuse or nondisclosure under this Agreement or the obligation to return or destroy certain materials.\\nI. The parties agree that money damages would not be suf\\ufb01cient remedy for any breach of this Agreement, and the non---breaching party shall be entitled to enforce this Agreement by injunctive and other available relief, including without limitation speci\\ufb01c performance.\\nJ. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed and interpreted in accordance with the substantive laws of the State of Utah. Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable law, but if any provision hereof shall be prohibited by or invalid under applicable law, such provision shall be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or invalidity, without invalidating the remainder of such provision or the remaining provisions of this Agreement. All obligations of the receiving party and rights of the disclosing party expressed in this Agreement shall be in addition to, and not in limitation of, those provided by applicable law. This Agreement may be modi\\ufb01ed or waived only by a separate writing by Signee and EICA expressly so modifying or waiving such. This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, but all of which together shall constitute one instrument. References to EICA and Signee shall be deemed to include each of their af\\ufb01liates, if any. Any disputes arising out of this Agreement shall be adjudicated in federal or state district court in the State of Utah and each party hereby consents to the jurisdiction of such court.
